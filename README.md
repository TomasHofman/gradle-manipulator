# Source code for Gradle manipulation plugins

## Analyzer

The `analyzer` directory contains the gradle plugin that generates metadata information about aligned dependencies and the project version.

## Manipulation

The `manipulation` directory contains the gradle plugin that uses the metadata information generated by the `alignment` plugin and
modifies the project to use those dependencies and project version.


## Testing on a real project

The plugins can be tested on real projects like so:

An init script is required. If a development version is being used it is built into `analyzer/build/resources/main/analyzer-init.gradle`. If a released version is being used it is deployed as `analyzer-<version>-init.gradle` e.g. http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/jboss/gm/analyzer/analyzer/1.0/analyzer-1.0-init.gradle

Now by executing the following command:

```
./gradlew --no-daemon --stacktrace --info --init-script analyzer-init.gradle generateAlignmentMetadata -DrestURL=http://some.da.server
```

you should get the `manipulation.json` file in the root of the project.
